# **Photo Naming Assistance Using AI**

## **Project Overview**
Managing large volumes of photos can be challenging, especially when it comes to organizing and finding specific images quickly. This project leverages AI to assist in naming photos in a way that simplifies archiving and searching.

## **How It Works**
Users are presented with photos and tasked with assigning clear, descriptive names based solely on what they see. These names should be simple yet detailed enough to allow for quick identification and retrieval. By focusing on key details like subjects, colors, actions, and unique elements, users ensure each photo is well-organized and easy to locate.

## **Prompt Example**
To guide users, a sample prompt is provided:

> "You are given a photo to archive, and your task is to assign a clear, descriptive name based on what you see. The name should make it easy to identify and understand the photo at a glance. Be specificâ€”include key details like subjects, colors, actions, or any unique elements. For example, if it's a dog, include details like breed, color, and activity. What will you name this photo?"

## **Technology Stack**
- **Backend**: Python with the ChatGPT API for natural language processing.

## **Key Features**
- **AI-Driven Assistance**: Helps users generate accurate, descriptive names based on visual elements in the photo.
- **Real-Time Suggestions**: Provides instant feedback and suggestions for naming based on image content.
  
## **Use Case**
This project is especially useful for:
- **Photographers**: Quickly name and organize large photo libraries.
- **Designers**: Archive images effectively for easy access and retrieval.
- **Social Media Managers**: Categorize and manage visual content efficiently.
